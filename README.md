# FUT Profit Calculator

As someone who dabbles in a bit of FIFA Ultimate Team trading, I wanted to create a tool that keeps track of profit/loss as you go.

This was an excellent test of my JavaScript knowledge, using event listeners, algorithms to determine profit/loss, and DOM manipulation for dynamic inputs.

The design for this was admittedly secondary, but I wanted to mirror the UX/UI of the Ultimate Team menus as best I could.
